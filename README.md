# Loan-Eligibility-Predictor
It is a Machine Learning based project in which we aim to find out that whether a person is eligible for loan or not, based on different attributes of the customers.

• Built it with the vision to automates the Loan Eligibility Process in a real
time scenario, based on different attributes of customers.

• Used various Machine Learning Algorithms, to obtain the best accuracy.

• Created the model using python libraries like numpy, matplotlib,
scikit-learn.

• Built the front end using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and linked the
model using python.
